Are you concerned about having to trawl through all the estate agencies in the area to find your new house for September? Well, look no further.

We're all about helping you, the students, right from setting up meetings with potential housemates to see if you're a good match, drive you from viewing to viewing, helping you with difficult tenancy issues, making sure you're looked after on moving in day, and all sorts of other things that come up throughout a tenancy. We aim to build a community where you can drop in to our Hangout Lounge, have sweets, coffee and joke around with us, or tell us your woes, because living away from home can be difficult and we want to take some of that pressure away from you.

Our aim is to create a fun environment for all students looking for student accommodation in Middlesbrough. We have a good relationship with the Teesside University Students' Union and are part of their accreditation team. Our speciality is en-suite accommodation, revevated to a high standard, with ALL THE BILLS INCLUDED + free wifi + TV licence all in. We also have an emergency out of hours number.

Anyway, enough waffling, hopefully you'll drop in to see us and say Hello!
